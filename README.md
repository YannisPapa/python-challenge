# python-challenge
This is my submission for Module 3 Challenge with Berkeley Data Analytics Boot Camp.

The python files can be found above in this repo.

In the folder there are 2 sub folders, one for PyPoll and one for PyBank. Each folder contains a main.py, a Resources folder and an analysis folder. Running the main.py will use the csv file located in Resources to generate an analysis text file in the analysis folder as well as output the analysis to command line.

The resulting text files are named budget_data_results.txt for PyBank and election_data_results.txt for PyPoll
